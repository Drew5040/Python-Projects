## Description

This projects functionality is more about showcasing my application development, and continuous integration
skills more than anything. Although the application itself does have utility. It is a currency converter. I was inspired
to make this application my first professionally developed project by my wife who works in finance.
She would regularly come home from work and talk about how difficult it was to source and calculate international exchange
rates. Therefore, I decided to kill two birds with one stone. I can help her solve a problem that she was having, and
I get to practice!

## Features

- graphical user interface (gui) built with the native Python library Tkinter
- source_currency field: 'USD'
- target_currency field: 'ANY INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY'
